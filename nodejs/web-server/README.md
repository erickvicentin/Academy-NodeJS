#Weather-App

This is my first app on Node.js, that I created follow the Udemy's course called: The Complete Node.js Developer Course (3rd Edition).

Next, I will detail how to carry out the correct installation of the project, what packages are necessary and how to use it.

Please, just clone the project and run

```
npm install
npm i nodemon@1.18.5
nodemon src/app.js -e js,hbs
```

to use the app. Enjoy!
